      <h4 vTypography="body-2-bold">Using Radio and Checkbox groups within a Listbox</h4>
      <p>
        The below examples are radio and checkbox groups <em>at their core</em>. Although they are styled to look like a
        listbox component, their functionality and API signatures moreso reflect radio and checkbox groups than listbox
        components.
      </p>
      <p>As such, Radio and Checkbox props should be used in this case over ListboxItem props.</p>
      <p>For example,</p>
      <ul vML="12">
        <li>- Radio or Checkbox <code>checked</code> should be used over ListboxItem <code>selected</code></li>
        <li>- Any <code>invalid</code> prop should be added directly to Radio or checkbox</li>
        <li>- Any <code>disabled</code> prop should be added directly to Radio or checkbox</li>
      </ul>
