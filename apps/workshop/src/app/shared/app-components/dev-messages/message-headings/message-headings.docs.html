    <p>The examples below use heading tags where titles are present.</p>
    <p>
      In our demo examples, we use headings that follow <span vTypography="body-2-bold">our</span> application's
      hierarchical structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is essential that you adjust these heading levels to match the structural needs of your application for optimal
      semantic accuracy and accessibility.
